"""
Write a program that solves the N queens problem.
* Usage: nqueens N
- If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
  print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
* Where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
- If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line,
  and exit with the status 1
- If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line,
  and exit with the status 1
* The program should print every possible solution to the problem
- One solution per line
- Format: see example
- You donâ€™t have to print the solutions in a specific order
* You are only allowed to import the sys module
